Our senior estimator moisture-tests your subfloor and inspects conditions during the free consultation, so there are no "unforeseen conditions" to surprise you later. The number on paper is the number on your invoice.' },
  { q: 'Can we stay in the house during the work?', a: 'Yes. Our dust containment captures roughly 99.7% of airborne particulate at the source using HEPA-sealed systems. Most refinishing clients sleep at home every night of the job, and our water-based finishes are low-odour and walk-on ready in 2–4 hours.' },
  { q: 'What warranty comes with the work?', a: 'Your finishes and materials carry their manufacturer warranties — typically 25–35 years on finish, up to 50 years structural — passed through to you in writing, itemized in your contract. If anything in our workmanship isn\u2019t right, we come back and make it right.' },
  { q: 'How long will my project take?', a: 'A standard 1,000–1,500 sq ft installation takes 5 to 7 working days: moisture testing and acclimation, installation, then sanding, staining and finishing. Refinishing is typically 3–5 days. Your written estimate includes a committed schedule.' },
